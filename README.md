### Licensing

If you'd like to remove the splash screens at any point; we can negotiate at a price. However, you will be responsible for removing them and not me. Otherwise, just leave the splash screens alone. This is a free framework and the least you can do is give credit.

### Installation

If you don't have NodeJS; please go install it.

The file structure below is the **required** structure you must use for this game mode. You must follow it exactly for this resource to work.

-   Grab the latest version of the alt:V server files. They must be clean. No resources.

-   Download [Postgres-Wrapper](https://github.com/team-stuyk-alt-v/altV-Postgres-Wrapper) this is the Postgres SQL helper that was written to make database usage easy. Extract it and put this into a folder called `postgres-wrapper`. Directly inside you should have `resource.cfg` if done correctly.

-   Install version **11.5** of [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for either windows, linux, or whatever OS you're running.

-   Once installed you need to create a username and password for your database; and create a database called 'altv' or something else if you know what you're doing. **PAY ATTENTION HERE YOU'LL NEED THIS INFO**

**Creating on Windows with pgAdmin4**
Where to navigate:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FBBeMTt.png)

Postgres is the username for this database; and altv is the name:
![](https://i.imgur.com/FaEmnvg.png)

After; it should be running automatically in your services on windows. You can always restart your database through your Task Manager.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6pA8PWB.png)

-   Download the latest version of this resource. You can either clone the repository or simply download it. The `resource.cfg` and the rest of the files should be directly inside of a folder called `orp`.

-   To configure your database, you will need the `resources/orp/server/configuration/database.mjs` file configured with the required parameters to connect to your database. Open `database.mjs.example`, fill out the required parameters, and save it to a new file named `database.mjs`.

**Example Database Configuration**

```js
export const DatabaseInfo = {
    username: 'postgres',
    password: 'abc123',
    address: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    dbname: 'altv'
};
```

**Example Folder Structure**

```yaml
altVServerFolder/
└── resources/
|   ├── orp/
|   |   ├── server/
|   |   ├── client/
|   |   └── resource.cfg
|   ├── postgres-wrapper/
|   |   ├── client.mjs
|   |   ├── database.mjs
|   |	└── resource.cfg
└── package.json
└── altv-server.exe
└── node_modules/
```

**Installing Packages for NodeJS**
After installing the above; if you don't have a package.json in your main server directory where your .exe is you're going to need to do the following:

Open a command prompt or powershell next to your .exe file

```
npm init
```

or

```
yarn init
```

Then press enter a bunch of times until its done stepping you through.

After you need to install the following packages from command prompt or power shell.

```
npm install typeorm
npm install sjcl
npm install pg
```

or

```
yarn add typeorm sjcl pg
```

Great; now you have all the prerequisites.

Open your `server.cfg` next to your `altv-server.exe`.

You need to add `orp` to resources.

```
